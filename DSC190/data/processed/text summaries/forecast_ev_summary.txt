RQ3: Short-run EV adoption forecasts (2020–2023-based)
-----------------------------------------------------

This summary compares national EV adoption forecasts (EVs per 1,000 residents, averaged across states) under:
  (1) a baseline charging-growth scenario, and
  (2) an accelerated charging-growth scenario.

Forecast horizon: 2024–2028

Final-year national EV adoption (EVs per 1,000 residents):
  Baseline scenario    : 152.66
  Accelerated scenario : 200.83
  Relative lift in 2028 (accelerated vs baseline): 31.6%

Approximate compound annual growth from 2023 to final year:
  Baseline CAGR   : nan% per year
  Accelerated CAGR: nan% per year

Interpretation (informal):
- Over 2024–2028, both scenarios imply continued growth in EV adoption relative to 2023.
- The accelerated scenario reaches a higher national EVs-per-1,000 level than the baseline, summarizing how faster infrastructure
  build-out could be associated with higher short-run EV penetration.
- These are short-run, scenario-based projections rather than precise long-run predictions.
